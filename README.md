punktum
=======

Yet another dotenv implementation for Rust. Just for fun. Don't use it, it
won't be maintained. You may fork it if you want to.

"Punkt" is the German word for "dot" and "Umgebung" means "environment".

**Work in progress!**

I'm trying to implement multiple dotenv dialects with mixed success. Also
so far I don't have any dependencies and like to keep it that way, which
might be a problem for certain dialects.
